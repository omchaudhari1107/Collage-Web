        <p>Swaminarayan Akshardham is a Hindu temple, and spiritual-cultural campus in Delhi, India. The temple is close
            to the border with Noida. Also referred to as Akshardham Temple or Akshardham Delhi, the complex displays
            millennia of traditional and modern Hindu culture, spirituality, and architecture. Inspired by Yogiji
            Maharaj and created by Pramukh Swami Maharaj, it was constructed by BAPS.[1]
            The temple[2] was officially opened on 6 November 2005 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in the presence of Dr. A. P.
            J. Abdul Kalam, Manmohan Singh, L.K Advani and B.L Joshi.[3][4] The temple, at the centre of the complex,
            was built according to the Vastu shastra and Pancharatra shastra.
            In Swaminarayan Akshardham, similar to its predecessor Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, the
            main shrine is the focal point and maintains the central position of the entire complex. There are various
            exhibition halls which provide information about the life and work of Swaminarayan. The designers of the
            complex have adopted contemporary modes of communication and technology to create the various exhibition
            halls.[5]
            The complex features an abhishek mandap, Sahaj Anand water show, a thematic garden, and three exhibitions
            namely Sahajanand Darshan (Hall of Values), Neelkanth Darshan (an IMAX film on the early life of
            Swaminarayan as the teenage yogi, Neelkanth), and Sanskruti Darshan (cultural boat ride). According to
            Swaminarayan Hinduism, the word Akshardham means the abode of Swaminarayan and believed by followers as a
            temporal home of God on earth.</p>

        <p>The Indroda Dinosaur and Fossil Park in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India, is a park that houses fossilized remains
            and petrified eggs of dinosaurs. It is a man-made fossil park and not the actual nesting grounds where the
            dinosaurs lived. The eggs and fossils on display here are from the world's 3rd-largest dinosaur fossil
            excavation site and 2nd-largest hatchery at Raiyoli, Balasinor, Gujarat.[1] The Park was set up by the
            Geological Survey of India[1][2] and is the only dinosaur museum in the country.[2]
            The park is run by the Gujarat Ecological and Research Foundation (GEER) and has been called India's
            Jurassic Park. The oldest record of dinosaur bone fossils is of middle Jurassic period, and they are found
            from Patcham formation of Kutch basin. The fossils which were found in Upper Cretaceous formations in the
            region date back 66 million years. The eggs are of different sizes, some the size of cannonballs. Fossil
            trackways of these gargantuan animals are also on display in the park.[1]
            Dinosaurs that are on display include Tyrannosaurus rex, Megalosaurus, Titanosaurus, Barapasaurus,
            Brachiosaurus, Antarctosaurus, Stegosaurus and Iguanodon.[1] The park displays life-size models of the
            dinosaurs along with details of each period in which they existed and characteristics of the animals.[1]
            The fossils were found in the Songhir Bagh Basin, the Himatnagar basin of Balasinor, south-eastern parts of
            Kheda, Panchmahal and Vadodara districts of the state.</p>
